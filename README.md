# feedback-visualiser

A tool that I created to help visualise the feedback I collect for my reports during each Appraisal season.

## Getting Started
1. Do a `npm install` on the root directory
2. Do a `npm run dev` to start the application
3. You can modify the details of the report, by going into `/src/assets/data.json` and modify accordingly. A sample data representation has been provided.
4. (Alternatively, you can drag and drop a compatible JSON file into the application.)

## Compiling an Offline Report
1. After doing a `npm run build` on the root directory, a single `index.html` will be created in the `/dist/` folder. This self-contained file can then be shared with the individual (as an individualised report).
