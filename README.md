# feedback-visualiser
 
A tool that I created to help visualise the feedback I collect for my reports during each Appraisal season.

![feedback-visualiser-demo](https://github.com/jinnotgin/feedback-visualiser/assets/14935308/ebfdf7d7-6814-4dfe-a3cc-029ed93669ee)

To modify the details of the report, go into `/src/assets/data.js` and modify accordingly. A sample data representation has been provided as well.

When running `npm run build`, a single `index.html` will be created in the `/dist/` folder. This self-contained file can then be shared with the individual (as an individualised report).
